# odin-recipes
This is the Recipes Project within the Foundations course found here https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes. The new repo, odin-recipes, was created for this project. The initial structure of the index.html is a simple heading with an unordered list beneath it on the page. There are currently three recipes. All recipe webpages are in the /recipes directory. Each recipe has an image in the /img directory.
Each recipe webpage structure is the heading, image, description, ingredients, and steps. The ingredients are in an unordered list. The steps are in an ordered list. All recipes and images are from ALLRECIPES and URLs can be found in each Steps section.
